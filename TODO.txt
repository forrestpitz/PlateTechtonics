[x] 1. Fix plate gen algorithm to be faster but still organic...
    [] b. Fix stranded cells
[] 2. Plate tectonics. We have the plates, now smash them together and change heights. Oceanic go under but should create mountains (this sounds hard)
    a. scale? What's max and min height in our world
[] 3. Moisture. Steps in my mind are:
    1. Start with even moisture everywhere
    2. Evaporate based on temp if over water
    3. Drop water (how? hieght should matter for rainfall...needs more consideration)
    4. Move moisture using wind vecotr to calculate new moisture map
    5. Repeat 1-4 n generations until complete

If all the above is finished we should have height and biome using a Whittaker Diagram http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/whittaker.

Future / Feature request:
[] 4. Add output to 3d renderer and move around in it.
[] 5. Perf improvements
[] 6. Scale up and see how big we can make it
[] 7. Fix 3d renderer so it's not minecraft, actual terrain would be sweet! (allows us to use partial integers).
    a. Use adjacent corners when calculating "cube" idk
[] 8. Clean up code. No seriously. It needs work
[] 9. Combine "maps" into one array of objects that have all the properties? Seems odd to store them separate
